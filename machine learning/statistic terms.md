### statistical terms
*  **uniform distribution**: A distribution in which all values have the same frequency.
*  **effect size**: a summary statistic intended to describe the size of an
effect. For example, to describe the difference between two groups, one obvious choice
is the difference in the means.
*  **probability mass function (PMF)**: a representation of a distribution as a function that maps from values to probabilities.
* **cumulative distribution function (CDF)**: The CDF is a function of x, where x is any value that might appear in the distribution. To evaluate CDF(x) for a particular value of x, we compute the fraction of values in the distribution less than or equal to x.
* **percentile rank**: The percentage of values in a distribution that are less than or equal to a given value.
* **percentile**: The value associated with a given percentile rank.
* **median**: The 50th percentile, often used as a measure of central tendency.
* **interquartile range**: The difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles, used as a measure of spread.
* **quantile**: A sequence of values that correspond to equally spaced percentile ranks; for example,
the quartiles of a distribution are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles.
